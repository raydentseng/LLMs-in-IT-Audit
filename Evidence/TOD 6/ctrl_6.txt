When a new joiner is scheduled to start, a ticket is created to initiate the onboarding process. The IT helpdesk reviews the ticket for validity. If accepted, the IT helpdesk submits an access request in IdentityNow based on the requested role. If the ticket was not submitted by the new joiner's manager, the manager must approve it before access is granted. Once approvals are in place, credentials and access rights are provisioned. Credentials are shared exactly seven days before the start date. The ticket is then closed by the IT helpdesk.
