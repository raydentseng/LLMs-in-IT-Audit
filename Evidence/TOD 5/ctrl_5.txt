When a new employee is hired, an HR employee initiates an access request by creating a ticket in JIRA. This ticket includes all relevant details regarding the new joiner's role, department, and required IT systems. Access will only be provisioned after the ticket has been reviewed and explicitly approved by the delegated manager responsible for the new joiner. Once approved, IT support grants access to the specified systems.
