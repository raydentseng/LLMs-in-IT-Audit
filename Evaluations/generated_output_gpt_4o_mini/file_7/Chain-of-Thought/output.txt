### Identification
**Control Attributes:**
1. **Request for Access Rights:** A ticket must be submitted by the IT department.
2. **Ticket Labeling:** The ticket should have labels 'access', 'joiner', and 'onboarding'.
3. **Manager Approval:** Approval from a delegate manager is required before provisioning access.
4. **Provisioning of Access:** IT is responsible for granting the access after approval.
5. **Closure of Ticket:** The ticket must be closed once the access is provisioned.

### Indication
**Identification in Evidence:**
1. **Request for Access Rights:** The evidence shows a ticket requesting onboarding for a new joiner, Melanie Brinkhaltes, submitted by Ronald Tijs.
2. **Ticket Labeling:** The ticket is labeled with 'onboarding' and 'joiner,' but confirmation that 'access' is included is not evident from the screenshot.
3. **Manager Approval:** There is an internal note showing that Erica Kat approved the request, which fulfills the manager approval requirement.
4. **Provisioning of Access:** There's no direct evidence provided that the access was actually provisioned; evidence of this step is unclear.
5. **Closure of Ticket:** The ticket is marked as "Resolved," implying that the closure process may have occurred.

### Completeness
**Critical Evidence Missing:**
1. **Direct Evidence of Access Provisioning:** There is no clear indication or evidence (e.g., logs, confirmation of access granted) showing that the actual provisioning of access took place.
2. **Confirmation of Ticket Labeling:** While two out of the three required labels are present, verification that the ticket includes the 'access' label is missing.

### Remarks
**Ambiguities/Inconsistencies:**
1. **Labeling of the Ticket:** Since 'access' is not mentioned visibly in the evidence, clarity on whether it was indeed labeled as required is necessary.
2. **Provisioning Evidence:** Without a confirmation or screenshot demonstrating that the access has been successfully provisioned, this step lacks transparency.
3. **Closure Documentation:** While the ticket is marked as resolved, there should be additional documentation showing what steps were taken during provisioning to ensure the completeness of the process.

### Conclusion
**Classification: B. Does not fully support.**
**Justification:** While the evidence shows a ticket and contains some aspects of the control processes (like approval), it lacks complete support due to missing confirmation of access provisioning and uncertainty regarding the complete labeling of the ticket. Additional documentation verifying these aspects would bolster the support for the control.
