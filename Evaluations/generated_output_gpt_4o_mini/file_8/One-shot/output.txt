### Identification
1. User access requests must be submitted via a standardized form by the HR department.
2. The Service Desk generates a ticket based on the submitted form.
3. VitalisIT is responsible for implementing the necessary changes in the StaffLinkHR system.

### Indication
1. **Page 1**: An email from HRM to the ServiceDesk contains a request regarding the standardized form for Emma de Vries, indicating it was submitted by HR.
2. **Page 2**: The standardized form provides essential details of the new joiner, including the manager's name, which is Jeroen van Dijk.
3. **Page 4**: A ticket in TopDesk generated by the ServiceDesk is visible, confirming that a ticket was created for the user access request.
4. **Page 5**: An email from VitalisIT confirms action taken on the request, showing that the necessary changes were made in the StaffLinkHR system.

### Completeness
Missing critical evidence includes:
- The actual implementation date of the access in the StaffLinkHR system is not explicitly mentioned.
- No confirmation of the ticket closure or the access granted being recorded in a final log.

### Remarks
1. The email does not specify if the standardized form contains the requisite approvals - it would be helpful to verify if the managerâ€™s approval is documented within the standardized form or ticket.
2. There is ambiguity regarding the exact implementation steps taken by VitalisIT as the ticket indicates only that it was resolved without detailing the access assigned.

### Conclusion
B. **Does not fully support** - While the evidence indicates a structured process was followed and the request was handled, the control's effectiveness cannot be fully confirmed due to missing confirmation of implementation and a lack of detailed evidence regarding the closure of the access request. Further clarification on approvals and implementation specifics would strengthen support for control execution.
