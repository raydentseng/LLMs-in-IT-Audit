### Identification:
The critical control attributes from the control description are:
1. Ticket submission by IT for access rights for a new joiner.
2. Specific labels: "access," "joiner," and "onboarding" for proper categorization.
3. Approval requirement from a delegate manager.
4. IT's responsibility for provisioning access after approval.
5. Ticket closure procedure to complete the process.

### Indication:
- **Ticket Submission**: The evidence shows a ticket created by Ronald Tijsens and labeled as "Onboarding new joiner." This indicates that the request for access was initiated properly.
- **Specific Labels**: The ticket includes the labels "access," "joiner," and "onboarding," satisfying the requirement for proper categorization.
- **Approval Requirement**: Erica Kat’s approval is documented in the comments section of the ticket. This shows that the delegate manager's approval was obtained.
- **IT Responsibility for Provisioning**: The request was made by IT, indicating that they are involved before access provisioning.
- **Ticket Closure**: The ticket status shows it is marked as "Opgezet" (Resolved), suggesting that the closure procedure was followed.

### Completeness:
While the evidence provides a substantial amount of information, the following pieces are critical yet missing:
- Documentation or logs showing that the access was actually provisioned to Melanie Brinkhaltes.
- Any records or screenshots of the actual access granted or permissions configured, confirming that the provisioning process was effectively completed.

### Remarks:
- The ticket mentions that Melanie should have the same access rights as another user (“Stevie van Tevie”). However, there is no evidence showing what those access rights entail or any assessment of whether that provisioning aligns with internal policies.
- The timestamp or date of the ticket closure is not clear, which might affect the understanding of whether the timing aligns with the onboarding process.
- Clarity on how access permissions are validated or monitored post-provisioning would also be beneficial to ensure ongoing compliance.
  
### Conclusion:
B. **Does not fully support** - evidence is incomplete or unclear and may require additional clarification; no clear deficiency is indicated.

**Justification**: Although much of the evidence aligns well with the control description, the absence of details around the actual access provisioned to the new joiner limits the ability to fully confirm the control's execution and effectiveness. This indicates that while processes were initiated correctly, the completeness of the audit trail is lacking, which requires further follow-up.
