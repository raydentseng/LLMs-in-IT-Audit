### Identification
Based on the control description, the control attributes are:
1. **Ticket Request**: Access rights must be requested through a ticket submitted by the IT department.
2. **Labeling**: Tickets must be labeled with "access," "joiner," and "onboarding."
3. **Manager Approval**: Approval from a delegate manager is required before provisioning access.
4. **Provisioning Responsibility**: IT is responsible for provisioning the access after approval.
5. **Ticket Closure**: The ticket must be closed once the access is provisioned.

### Indication
To identify the attributes in the evidence:
1. **Ticket Request**: The evidence displays a ticket titled "Onboarding new joiner Melanie Brinkhaltens" which suggests a request was made.
2. **Labeling**: The labels "access," "joiner," and "onboarding" are shown in the ticket details, confirming proper categorization.
3. **Manager Approval**: An internal note included in the evidence shows a message from Erica Kat approving the onboarding, indicating that manager approval was obtained.
4. **Provisioning Responsibility**: Although the evidence indicates the request for provisioning, it does not explicitly confirm that the IT team completed this action.
5. **Ticket Closure**: The ticket status shows "Completed," which implies that the ticket was closed, but it is essential to verify that it was done after access provisioning.

### Completeness
Critical evidence that is missing includes:
- A confirmation log or documentation from the IT team showing that access was provisioned as requested.
- Specified timestamps for when the approval was received and when provisioning was completed to establish the timeline of the process.

### Remarks
Ambiguous elements in the control description or evidence:
- The evidence indicates an approval from the manager, but it does not show definitive action taken by IT regarding the provisioning of access.
- The actual access granted to Melanie Brinkhaltens is not documented in the provided evidence, which may lead to questions about the actual execution of the control.

Additional information that would help resolve these issues includes:
- A detailed log from IT indicating the exact action taken to provision access, including timestamps.
- A confirmation that the access rights granted aligned with the specified permissions.

### Conclusion
**Classification: B. Does not fully support - evidence is incomplete or unclear and may require additional clarification, no clear deficiency is indicated.**

**Justification**: While some evidence indicates that the control process was initiated and partially executed (ticket creation, request, and approval), the lack of clear documentation regarding the actual provisioning of access prevents a full endorsement of the control effectiveness. Additional verification is needed regarding the completion of access provisioning and associated documentation.
