### Identification
**Control Attributes:**
1. User access requests must be authorized via a standardized form.
2. Requests are submitted by the HR department to the ServiceDesk.
3. The ServiceDesk generates a ticket in TopDesk.
4. VitalisIT is responsible for implementing changes in the StaffLinkHR system.
5. Evidence of actions taken should correlate with roles and access permissions assigned.

### Indication
**Identification in Evidence:**
1. **Standardized Form:** The "Indiensttredingsformulier" (employment entry form) is seen in the documents, indicating the form is used for user access requests.
2. **HR Submission:** An email from HRM to the ServiceDesk (document 1) shows the submission of access requests, referencing the standardized form of Emma de Vries.
3. **ServiceDesk Ticket:** The request entry in TopDesk (document 4) indicates a ticket generated for Emma de Vries on April 4, 2023.
4. **Implementation by VitalisIT:** An email from VitalisIT confirming that the account and access for Emma de Vries were set up in StaffLinkHR (document 4).

### Completeness
**Missing Evidence:**
- There is no clear evidence that the standardized form was formally approved or signed by an HR representative before submission.
- Confirmation of the individual who implemented the access in StaffLinkHR and any logs or records of that implementation step is lacking.

### Remarks
**Ambiguities and Inconsistencies:**
- The email from the ServiceDesk does not explicitly confirm that all necessary approvals were in place before processing the request. It would benefit from additional context on whether the form was fully completed as per policy.
- It is unclear whether "VitalisIT" acting on the request is documented within any operational procedures. A reference to changes implemented with date and time stamps could strengthen this area.

### Conclusion
**Classification: B - Does not fully support**
The evidence demonstrates several steps in the access request process but lacks critical documentation of approval and comprehensive change logs. Some steps may be inferred, but they are not explicitly detailed, necessitating further clarification to ensure compliance with the control description.
