Identification
1. Standardized form for user access request.
2. HR submits request to the ServiceDesk.
3. ServiceDesk generates ticket in TopDesk.
4. VitalisIT implements correct changes in StaffLinkHR.

Indication
1. At page 1, we inspect that a standardized form was attached in the email. At page 2, we inspect the standardized form.
2. At page 1, we inspect that Jan Loos, an HR employee, sent the email to ServiceDesk.
3. At page 4, we inspect a TopDesk ticket created by Mark Rover from department ServiceDesk.

Completeness
No evidence is missing.

Remarks
1. We inspect at page 5 and page 6 that the access that was granted does not match the access that was requested. ‘Coördinator - Nachtverslaglegging’ was given, while ‘Verpleegkundig Specialist’ was requested.

Conclusion
C. Does not support. It violates the policy as the wrong roles were assigned to the IT system. ‘Coördinator - Nachtverslaglegging’ was given, while ‘Verpleegkundig Specialist’ was requested.
