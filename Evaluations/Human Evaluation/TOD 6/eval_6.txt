Identification
1. A ticket is created to initiate the onboarding process.
2. IT helpdesk reviews the ticket for validity.
3. If accepted, IT helpdesk submits an access request in IdentityNow.
4. Manager submits or approves ticket before access is granted.
5. After approval, access rights are provisioned.
6. Credentials are shared exactly seven days before approval.
7. Ticket is closed by IT helpdesk.

Indication
1. At page 1, we inspect a ticket with ticket number I 156 39876. On page 2, we inspect that Lars Rots created the ticket on 2 Jul.
2. At page 2, we inspect that Nils van Tetter assigned himself to the ticket, and accepted the ticket on 9 Jul 14:00.
3. At page 2, Nils van Tetter added a comment noting that he submitted the access request on 9 Jul 14:30.
6. At page 1, Nils van Tetter commented that the credentials were shared on 7 Aug. This is exactly 7 days before starting date 14 Aug.
7. At page 1, Nils van Tetter made changes, closing the ticket on 7 Aug at 12:00.

Completeness
The evidence does not provide an approval by a delegated manager.

Remarks
1. Nils van Tetter mentioned that credentials were shared, but does not provide evidence.
2. The confirmation mail of access provisioning must be checked for validity.
3. The Excel screen at page 3 indicates that Lars Rots is not a delegated manager. According to the policy, there is a missing approval.

Conclusion
B. Does not fully support. Based on this evidence, we cannot confirm that the evidence supports the control description. This is because we cannot confirm that Lars Rots is a delegated manager, and an approval is missing.
