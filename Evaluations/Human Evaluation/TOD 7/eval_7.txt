Identification
1. Ticket is created by the IT department.
2. Ticket has labels ‘access’, ‘joiner’, ‘onboarding’.
3. Approval is required before access is provisioned.
4. After approval, IT provides access.
5. Ticket is closed.

Indication
1. At page 1, we inspect that Ronald Tijsen (IT) created a JIRA ticket on 10 Jun 2024.
2. At page 1, we inspect that the ticket has the correct labels.
5. At page 1, we inspect that the ticket was closed on 28 Jun.

Completeness
The evidence does not indicate the roles of both the new joiner and the mirror user.

Remarks
1. We inspect at page 2 that access was granted on 7 Jun. This violates the policy, as access is granted before date of approval. 
2. We cannot verify whether the access of Stevie and Melanie are the same.
3. We can not explicitly verify that Erica is the delegated manager.

Conclusion
C. Does not support. This evidence indicates a violation of the policy because access has been granted before approval.
