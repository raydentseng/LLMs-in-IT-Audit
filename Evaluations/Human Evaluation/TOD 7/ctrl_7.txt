In case of a new joiner, access rights must be requested through a ticket submitted by the IT department. The ticket must be labeled with ``access'', ``joiner'', and ``onboarding'' to ensure proper categorization. Approval from a delegate manager is required before any access is provisioned. Once approval has been obtained, IT is responsible for provisioning the access. Following the implementation, the ticket must be closed to complete the process.
