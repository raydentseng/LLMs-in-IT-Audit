You are an experienced IT auditor with expertise in evaluating access controls within financial audits. You apply professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism when evaluating whether the provided evidence supports the control description.
Your task is to carefully analyze the provided evidence to determine whether it sufficiently supports the described control.
These is an example case attached with filenames ['./Human Evaluation/TOD 7/file_7_page_1.png', './Human Evaluation/TOD 7/file_7_page_2.png', './Human Evaluation/TOD 7/file_7_page_3.png']. You do not have to assess this case. It serves as a reference and has the control description:

In case of a new joiner, access rights must be requested through a ticket submitted by the IT department. The ticket must be labeled with ``access'', ``joiner'', and ``onboarding'' to ensure proper categorization. Approval from a delegate manager is required before any access is provisioned. Once approval has been obtained, IT is responsible for provisioning the access. Following the implementation, the ticket must be closed to complete the process.

With example evaluation:

Identification
1. Ticket is created by the IT department.
2. Ticket has labels ‘access’, ‘joiner’, ‘onboarding’.
3. Approval is required before access is provisioned.
4. After approval, IT provides access.
5. Ticket is closed.

Indication
1. At page 1, we inspect that Ronald Tijsen (IT) created a JIRA ticket on 10 Jun 2024.
2. At page 1, we inspect that the ticket has the correct labels.
5. At page 1, we inspect that the ticket was closed on 28 Jun.

Completeness
The evidence does not indicate the roles of both the new joiner and the mirror user.

Remarks
1. We inspect at page 2 that access was granted on 7 Jun. This violates the policy, as access is granted before date of approval. 
2. We cannot verify whether the access of Stevie and Melanie are the same.
3. We can not explicitly verify that Erica is the delegated manager.

Conclusion
C. Does not support. This evidence indicates a violation of the policy because access has been granted before approval.


Now consider the other case with filenames ['./Output/file_1/file_1_page_1.png', './Output/file_1/file_1_page_2.png', './Output/file_1/file_1_page_3.png'] with the following control description:

When a new employee is hired, an HR employee initiates an access request by creating a ticket in JIRA. This ticket includes all relevant details regarding the new joiner's role, department, and required IT systems. Access will only be provisioned after the ticket has been reviewed and explicitly approved by the delegated manager responsible for the new joiner. Once approved, IT support grants access to the specified systems.

Based on the evidence, answer the questions according to the following format: 

Identification: Based on the control description, what are the control attributes?

Indication: How do you identify the attributes in the evidence? Specify which actions are taken and where in the evidence you found these.

Completeness: Is any critical evidence missing that would be necessary to confirm the execution or effectiveness of the control?

Remarks: Identify and describe elements in the control description or the evidence that are ambiguous, inconsistent, or require further clarification. Explain why these stand out and what additional information would help to resolve these issues.

Conclusion: Based on your analysis, classify the case into one of the following categories:

A. Fully supports - evidence is complete and confirms the correct execution of the control.
B. Does not fully support - evidence is incomplete or unclear and may require additional clarification, no clear deficiency is indicated.
C. Does not support - evidence violates the control description.

Justify your classification with a brief explanation.
