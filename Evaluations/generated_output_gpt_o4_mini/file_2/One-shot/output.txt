Identification  
Based on the control description, the attributes we would expect to see are:  
1. A ticket is created to initiate the onboarding process.  
2. The IT helpdesk reviews the ticket for validity and—if valid—“accepts” it.  
3. An access request is submitted in IdentityNow, mapping to the roles requested on the ticket.  
4. If the ticket was not originally submitted by the new-joiner’s manager, a manager approval step occurs.  
5. Once approvals are in place, credentials and access rights are provisioned.  
6. Credentials are shared exactly seven days prior to the start date.  
7. The ticket is closed by the IT helpdesk after provisioning and credential sharing are complete.  

Indication  
1. Ticket creation (Attribute 1)  
   – Page 2 (“People / Dates”): “Created: 02/Jul/24 14:49” by Lars Rots (Reporter).  
2. IT helpdesk review and acceptance (Attribute 2)  
   – Page 2, activity on 09/Jul/24 14:00: Status changes from “Open” to “Accepted [123]” and Assignee changes from “IT Helpdesk” to “Nils van Tetter.”  
3. Submission of the IdentityNow access request (Attribute 3)  
   – Page 2, comment on 09/Jul/24 14:30 by Nils van Tetter: “Submitted the following in IdentityNow:” followed by a table of roles exactly matching the ticket’s “Role(s): Backend Developer” (page 1).  
4. Manager approval (Attribute 4)  
   – No explicit approval record is present, but page 2 shows Reporter = Lars Rots. Page 3 (Delegates in IdentityNow spreadsheet) lists “Rots, lars.rots@ayia.com” with is_manager = TRUE. Because the ticket was created by the manager, no separate approval step was required under the control.  
5. Provisioning of credentials and access rights (Attribute 5)  
   – Page 2, comment on 26/Jul/24 12:13 records the email from no-reply@identitynow.com sent at 09:35 that same morning: “Access has been granted to the following roles: … Done.” Status changes from “Accepted [123]” to “In IdentityNow [12450].”  
6. Credentials shared exactly seven days before start date (Attribute 6)  
   – Page 1 (“Starting date: 14/Aug/24”), and page 1 activity on 07/Aug/24 10:20: “Credentials shared with Jan Rons.” That is exactly 7 days prior.  
7. Ticket closure (Attribute 7)  
   – Page 1, activity on 07/Aug/24 12:00: Resolution changes to “Done” and Status to “Closed.”  

Completeness  
All critical steps in the control description are evidenced: the ticket’s lifecycle from creation, through IT validation and IdentityNow submission, to provisioning, credential sharing at exactly seven days before start, and final closure.  

Remarks  
– Manager approval: There is no explicit “Approved by manager” comment, but the reporter (Lars Rots) is confirmed as the employee’s manager via the delegates spreadsheet. Under the control, a separate approval is only required if the ticket is not manager-initiated, so this is acceptable.  
– Status codes “[123]” and “[12450]” are system-specific. We assume “[12450] = ‘In IdentityNow’” equates to “provisioning complete,” but a mapping reference would be helpful.  
– The “Active Hardware: None” field on page 1 is irrelevant to the control but does not affect the conclusion.  

Conclusion  
A. Fully supports – the evidence is complete and demonstrates that each step of the control was performed in the correct sequence and in accordance with the requirement.
